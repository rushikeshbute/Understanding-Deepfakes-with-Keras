# Understanding-Deepfakes-with-Keras
In this 2-hour long project-based course, you will learn to implement DCGAN or Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network, and you will train the network to generate realistic looking synthesized images. The term Deepfake is typically associated with synthetic data generated by Neural Networks which is similar to real-world, observed data - often with synthesized images, videos or audio. Through this hands-on project, we will go through the details of how such a network is structured, trained, and will ultimately generate synthetic images similar to hand-written digit 0 from the MNIST dataset. Since this is a practical, project-based course, you will need to have a theoretical understanding of Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent. We will focus on the practical aspect of implementing and training DCGAN, but not too much on the theoretical aspect. You will also need some prior experience with Python programming.

# Learning Objectives
